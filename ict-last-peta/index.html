<h2>About</h2>
<p style="color: white; text-align: justify;">The tale of the Tikbalang explores one of the most mysterious and feared creatures in
 Philippine folklore—a towering being with the head of a horse 🐴 and the body of a man. Known for its eerie laughter echoing through
 the trees 🌬️ and its ability to make travelers lose their way 🌀, the Tikbalang is more than just a forest monster.
</p>
<p style="color: white; text-align: justify;">
 It symbolizes the unknown, the power of nature, and the consequences of disrespecting sacred lands ⚠️.
 The story dives deep into its cunning tricks, its ancient role as a guardian, and the lessons learned by 
 those who dare cross its path. Through this tale, readers uncover fear, wonder, and the delicate balance 
 between humans and the supernatural.

<i>
🌬️ When the wind suddenly stops… <b>it is watching.</b><br>
🌀 When the path twists back to where you began… <b>it is playing with you.</b><br>
🌒 And when the shadows stretch longer than they should… <b>the Tikbalang is near.</b>
</i>
<br><br>
Few have seen it step out of the darkness—and even fewer have escaped to speak of what happens next…
