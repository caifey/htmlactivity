<h1>TIKBALANG</h1>
<p style="color: white; text-align: justify;">
 The origin of the Tikbalang traces back to pre-colonial Philippine mythology,
 where ancient Filipinos believed that spirits lived in forests, mountains, and
 rivers. Among these spirits was the Tikbalang, a powerful guardian of nature with
 the head of a horse and the body of a man. Early tribes considered it a forest 
 sentinel, capable of protecting sacred places from intruders. It was said that the
 Tikbalang could bend paths, create illusions, and confuse travelers who did not show
 respect to the land. Stories were passed down through babaylans and elders, teaching
 that the creature was not inherently evil but a reminder to honor the spirits of the wilderness.
<br><br>
 During the Spanish colonial period, the image of the Tikbalang evolved. As horses were introduced 
 to the Philippines, people began combining the animal’s features with older native legends, giving
 the Tikbalang its more familiar horse-headed appearance. Priests used the legend to warn villagers
 about wandering into forests or practicing pagan rituals, reinforcing fear of the unknown. Despite
 centuries of change, the Tikbalang remains one of the most iconic beings in Filipino folklore—mysterious, mischievous,
 and deeply tied to the Filipino landscape and culture.

<h1>✨ My Reflection</h1>
<p style="color: white; text-align: justify;">
 Working on this project has taught me a lot and helped me understand how websites are made.
 At first, I found some parts confusing, especially when the image or text did not appear the
 way I wanted. But as I kept trying and adjusting the code, I started to understand how HTML 
 and CSS work together. I learned how to place text over an image, how to adjust sizes, and 
 how to style different elements. The process took patience, but it also felt rewarding each
 time something finally worked. Overall, this project helped me gain confidence and made me 
 realize that learning step-by-step is the key to improving.
