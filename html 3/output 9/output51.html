<h2>Methodology</h2>
<hr>
<p>The study utilized a comparative observational design at two distinct sites: Zone A (river bend) and Zone B (straight channel). Baseline width and bank slope measurements were established during dry conditions, followed by real-time debris counts during heavy rainfall to monitor peak flow transport. Post-flood, a line transect analysis was performed along 50-meter stretches of the riverbank to categorize and quantify snagged debris, providing empirical data to validate the mathematical model's predictions on how specific geometries facilitate waste retention.</p>
