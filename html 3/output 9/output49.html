<h2>Statement of the Problem</h2>
<hr>
<p>1.) How does the geometric structure of the Marikina River (such as curvature, width variation, and narrow sections) affect the movement, escape, and accumulation of plastic debris during flood conditions?<br><br>

2.) Can a geometry-driven mathematical model accurately predict locations where plastic debris is most likely to accumulate or escape during flooding events?<br><br>

3.) How can the predicted accumulation zones be used to improve the placement of trash traps and flood mitigation strategies along the Marikina River?</p>
