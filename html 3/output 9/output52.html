<p>The analysis confirmed that river geometry is a critical determinant of debris behavior, with high-curvature zones and narrowing channels exhibiting the greatest accumulation. The model demonstrated that inner river curves experience reduced flow velocity and increased centrifugal force, effectively creating natural traps for floating waste. Conversely, straight segments facilitated high-velocity transport, acting as escape routes for debris moving downstream. </p>
