<h2>Research Objectives</h2>
<hr>
<p>The primary goal of this study was to develop ColorSmart, a robotic pork storage system that integrates a turmeric-based colorimetric indicator with an Arduino TCS3200 color sensor. Specifically, the research aimed to prepare a pH-sensitive natural indicator that exhibits visible color shifts during the meat spoilage process. Furthermore, the study intended to calibrate the sensor system to accurately detect these shifts using RGB values, providing a quantifiable and automated method for monitoring the freshness of pork samples in a market setting.
