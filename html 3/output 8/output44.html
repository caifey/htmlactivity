<h2>Statement of the Problem</h2>
<hr>
<p>1.) Is there a relationship between the time duration of exposure of the natural indicator to spoilage gases and the RGB values detected by the color sensor?<br><br>

2.) What are the distinct RGB values recorded by the color sensor corresponding to the fresh, early spoilage, and spoiled conditions?<br><br>

3.) Will the LED change color corresponding to the change of color of the natural indicator?
