<h2>Methodology</h2>
<hr>
<p>The study employed an experimental design utilizing curcumin infused strips composed of 60 percent turmeric and 40 percent distilled water as a natural pH indicator. Fresh pork samples were monitored at room temperature over a 24 hour period to simulate market conditions. An Arduino Uno was used to process data from a TCS3200 color sensor, which captured RGB values at 0, 4, and 24 hour intervals. The system was programmed to interpret these color shifts from yellow to reddish brown and activate a corresponding LED alert using green, yellow, or red to signal the meat’s current level of freshness.
