<h2>Results</h2>
<hr>
<p>The results demonstrated a significant increase in RGB values as the spoilage progressed, with color averages rising from 316.7 (fresh) to 668.3 (fully spoiled). Statistical verification via a One-Way ANOVA yielded a p-value of 1.63 × 10⁻²⁶, which is far below the 0.05 significance level. This confirms that the color shifts detected by the sensor were highly significant and directly linked to the meat's condition rather than random variation. These findings prove that the integrated sensor system effectively quantifies the chemical reaction of the turmeric strip, successfully identifying the various stages of pork decomposition.
