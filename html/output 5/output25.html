<h2>Research Objectives</h2>
<hr>

<p>1.) To compare the photosynthetic responses of Acer mono and Acer pseudosieboldianum seedlings under different light intensities (100%, 75%, 55%, and 20% of full light).</p>
<p>2.) To evaluate the growth performance of both species in terms of seedling height, basal stem diameter, leaf number, leaf area per plant, and total dry weight under varying light conditions.</p>
<p>3.) To determine the physiological adaptations of seedlings through measurements of antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, POD, CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA) content, free proline, and soluble protein levels.</p>
<p>4.) To assess the overall adaptability and shade tolerance strategies of both maple species based on their photosynthetic, morphological, and physiological traits.</p>
<p>5.) To identify which species exhibits greater resilience and adaptability to light-induced stress.</p>
