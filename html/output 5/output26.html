<h2>Statement of the Problem</h2>
<hr>

<p>1.) How do Acer mono and A. pseudosieboldianum differ in their photosynthetic parameters (Amax, LSP, LCP) under varying light intensities?</p>
<p>2.) What are the effects of different light intensities on the growth performance of the two maple species?</p>
<p>3.) How do the physiological indicators (MDA levels, antioxidant enzyme activities, proline and soluble protein content) of seedlings change under light stress?</p>
<p>4.) What morphological adjustments (RSR, SLA) do seedlings develop to adapt to reduced light conditions?</p>
<p>5.) Which maple species demonstrates stronger adaptability and tolerance to light variation?</p>
