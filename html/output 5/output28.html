<p>Acer mono showed higher photosynthetic capacity (Amax, LSP) and grew best under 75% light, while A. pseudosieboldianum performed better under 55% light. Both species experienced increased MDA levels under very high (100%) and very low (20%) light, indicating oxidative stress. Shade conditions led to adaptive changes such as higher specific leaf area (SLA) and lower root-shoot ratio. Overall, A. pseudosieboldianum showed slightly stronger adaptability to light variation.</p>
