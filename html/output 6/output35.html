<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<hr>

<p>It is recommended that building managers integrate infrared thermal monitoring to supplement traditional CO2 sensors for more responsive ventilation control. Future research should include a larger demographic to determine if age or physical stature significantly influences vocal heat production rates. Additionally, testing the system in larger industrial stockrooms is advised to evaluate sensor sensitivity in high-volume environments. Finally, incorporating a dedicated CO2 gas sensor alongside the thermal unit could provide a more robust dual-verification system for indoor air safety.</p>
