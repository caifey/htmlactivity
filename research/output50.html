<h2>Research Objectives</h2>
<hr>
<p>This research seeks to engineer a geometry-driven mathematical model to predict the escape and accumulation patterns of plastic debris in the Marikina River during flood conditions. The study focuses on integrating structural variables such as curvature intensity and channel narrowing with hydraulic parameters to pinpoint high-risk zones for waste retention. Ultimately, the investigation aims to provide a data-driven framework for local authorities to optimize trash trap placement and modernize urban river management strategies.</p>
