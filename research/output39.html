<h2>Methodology</h2>
<hr>
<p>A Quasi-Experimental research design was utilized to determine the viability of Bermuda Grass (Cynodon dactylon) as a sustainable alternative for paper production. The study was conducted at Sta. Elena High School under the Schools Division of Marikina City, involving 20 Grade 7 STE (Science, Technology, and Engineering) students as respondents during the 2022–2023 academic year. For data collection, a researcher-validated survey was administered via Google Forms, focusing on the technical evaluation of the grass paper. Participants assessed the material’s performance based on four primary criteria: durability, texture, overall quality, and environmental impact.</p>
