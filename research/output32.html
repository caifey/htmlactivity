<h2>Methodology</h2>
<hr>

<p>The study utilized a quasi-experimental design in a controlled, unventilated classroom. Twenty participants, aged 12 to 14, engaged in conversation for 25 minutes while baseline and peak thermal data were recorded. An Arduino Uno integrated with a DHT11 sensor and an infrared detector was used to log temperature shifts at five-minute intervals. A standard room thermometer was employed as a cross-reference to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the sensor readings.</p>
