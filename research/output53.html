<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<hr>
<p>It is recommended that local authorities prioritize trash trap installation at river bends and narrowing sections where debris naturally aggregates. Future research should integrate 3D bathymetric data to account for underwater topographical influences on debris transport. Additionally, testing the model's scalability across various urban river systems in Metro Manila is advised. Finally, investigating the interaction between different plastic types such as buoyant bottles versus submerged sachets and river geometry could further refine targeted cleanup operations. </p>
