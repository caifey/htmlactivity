<h2>Methodology</h2>
<hr>

<p>This study used seedlings of two maple species, Acer mono and Acer pseudosieboldianum, grown under four controlled light intensities: 100%, 75%, 55%, and 20% of full light. Photosynthetic parameters (Amax, LSP, LCP) were measured using a portable photosynthesis system. Growth traits including seedling height, basal stem diameter, leaf number, leaf area per plant, and total dry weight were recorded at the end of the experiment. Physiological indicators such as malondialdehyde (MDA) content, antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, POD, CAT), free proline, and soluble protein levels were analyzed using standard biochemical assays. Data were compared across species and light treatments to evaluate differences in photosynthetic performance, growth response, and stress adaptation mechanisms.</p>
