<h2>Results</h2>
<hr>
<p>The study expects to demonstrate that a mobile robot using the A* algorithm and ultrasonic sensors will navigate crop fields more efficiently than a robot following a fixed path. It is anticipated that the system will successfully detect and avoid obstacles in real-time, reducing the risk of collisions. Additionally, the integration of soil moisture sensors is expected to provide accurate, site-specific data, allowing for a clearer map of moisture levels across the field. If successful, the robot should prove to be a reliable and low-cost alternative for monitoring soil conditions in small-scale farming.
