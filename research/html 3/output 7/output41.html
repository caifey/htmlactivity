<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<hr>
<p>To improve the quality of the product, future researchers should explore advanced pulping and refining techniques to enhance the paper’s texture and ink receptivity. It is also recommended to conduct a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) to formally compare the water and energy savings of grass paper against traditional wood-pulp methods. Additionally, studies focusing on the economic scalability of Bermuda Grass paper are necessary to ensure it can be produced at a price point competitive with commercial brands. Lastly, the use of various natural binders should be tested to increase the paper’s tensile strength for more demanding applications.</p>
