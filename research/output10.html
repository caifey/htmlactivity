<p>The robot is expected to monitor environmental factors and identify insect infestations more precisely and effectively than traditional hand inspection. By utilizing sensor-based detection, the system aims to provide a reliable data stream that minimizes human error and allows for the identification of pest-conducive environments (high humidity/specific temperatures) before a full infestation occurs.
