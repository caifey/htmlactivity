<p>Table 1 shows that alkaloids and tannins are present in the extract of Saluyot. The presence of alkaloids increases the potential of Saluyot as antifungal.</p>

<p>Table 2 shows that the Control (Canesten) displayed the widest ZOI of 22 mm. The pure extract (T1) showed the second widest ZOI of 14.67 mm. The 25% Saluyot extract (T4) is considered as the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration since it still inhibited the growth of Trichophyton mentagrophytes. With the Fvalue of 36.625 and F-critical of 6.05 of OneWay ANOVA statistics, the F-value is greater than the F-critical. Therefore the null hypothesis.</p>
