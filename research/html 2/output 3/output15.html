<h2>Methodology</h2>
<hr>
<p>This research uses an experimental design to build and test a mobile robot. The robot is constructed using an Arduino Uno "brain," ultrasonic sensors to detect objects, and soil moisture sensors to take readings. Using the Arduino IDE, the robot is programmed with the A* algorithm, which allows it to calculate the best path and move around obstacles automatically. To test the system, the robot will be placed in a controlled area with various objects in its way. The researchers will then measure how fast the robot reaches its goal, how many times it hits an object, and how well it transmits moisture data to a remote device.
