<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<hr>

<p>Use A. mono in areas with moderate to high light and A. pseudosieboldianum in moderately shaded environments. Avoid full sunlight or heavy shading for seedlings to reduce stress. Nursery cultivation should apply 55–75% light for optimal growth. Future studies should explore gene expression and cellular responses to better understand light adaptation mechanisms.</p>
