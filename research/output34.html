<h2>Results</h2>
<hr>

<p>The data demonstrated a direct correlation between vocal activity and temperature increase, with the environment warming from a baseline of 30°C to a peak of 38°C within 20 minutes. This thermal rise coincided with a noticeable decline in air quality, confirming that heat generated from speaking and movement serves as a reliable indicator of increased CO2 levels in confined volumes. The results prove that infrared sensors can effectively detect human presence and intensity through localized heat signatures.</p>
