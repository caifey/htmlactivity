<h2>Methodology</h2>
<hr>
<p> After the robot has been fully coded and completed, the researcher will conduct a test to determine the efficiency of the robot. A large testing area, approximately 10 by 10 meters, will be prepared. The researchers will scatter various waste products throughout the area to evaluate the following: the accuracy of the robot in identifying different types of waste products; the speed and time taken by the robot to detect and collect different types of waste; the maximum range at which the robot can detect waste; and the maximum amount of waste the robot can collect across different waste types. The researchers will conduct the test using three sets of ten trials, each with different placements of the waste products. Each trial will last up to five minutes and will contain 50 different waste items, with an increase of 10 waste products between each set of trials.
