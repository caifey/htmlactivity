<h2>Methodology</h2>
<hr>
<p>The study follows a developmental research design involving the assembly of an Arduino-based robot on a four-wheel chassis. Key hardware components including the ESP32-CAM, DHT22 sensor, and soil moisture sensor are integrated using an Arduino Uno R3 as the central processing unit. The robot is programmed to traverse ten-meter rows in a rice field, stopping every meter to collect data. This procedure is repeated across three separate trials to ensure consistency. The gathered data is then analyzed and compared against traditional manual inspection results to validate the system's effectiveness and precision.
