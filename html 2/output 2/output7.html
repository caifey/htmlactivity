<h2>Research Objectives</h2>
<hr>
<p>The primary objective of this research is to develop, build, and assess an Arduino-Based Vision and Environmental Monitoring Robot for early rice field insect detection. Specifically, the study aims to create a system that integrates an ESP32-CAM module with DHT22 and soil moisture sensors to provide real-time data on crop health. Another goal is to evaluate the robot's ability to identify insect infestations more precisely and effectively than traditional manual inspection. Ultimately, the project intends to provide small-scale farmers with an affordable, accessible, and sustainable alternative to manual labor, thereby increasing rice production and reducing the necessity for chemical pesticides.
