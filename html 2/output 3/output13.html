<h2>Research Objectives</h2>
<hr>
<p>The objective of this study is to develop a small, sensor-based robotic system capable of monitoring soil moisture in crop fields. The research specifically aims to design an affordable four-wheeled base that uses an Arduino Uno microcontroller and ultrasonic sensors to navigate obstacles in real time. Additionally, the study seeks to implement the A* path-planning algorithm to ensure the robot can autonomously find the most efficient route while transmitting moisture data wirelessly to farmers for better irrigation management.</p>
