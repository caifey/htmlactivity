<h2>Statement of the Problem</h2>
<hr>
<p>1.) How can a cost-effective agricultural robot be developed to provide Filipino farmers with precise, real-time soil moisture data?<br><br>

2.) In what ways can the integration of ultrasonic sensors and the A* algorithm improve the obstacle avoidance and navigation efficiency of autonomous mobile robots in a farm setting?<br><br>

3.) How does the use of a mobile sensor-based system compare to traditional manual irrigation methods in terms of resource conservation and crop health?<br><br>
